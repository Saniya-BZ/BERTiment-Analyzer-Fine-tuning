# BERTiment-Analyzer-Fine-tuning

The aim of the project is to build a sentiment classification system using the BERT model, which is capable of analyzing and predicting the emotional tone (sentiment) of text. The model identifies one of six predefined emotions:

1. Joy
2. Anger
3. Love
4. Fear
5. Sadness
6. Surprise
   
The workflow includes data preprocessing, fine-tuning the BERT model for sequence classification on labeled sentiment data, and validating the model's performance. It concludes with a functional system capable of predicting the sentiment of unseen text inputs.

This project demonstrates the application of transfer learning and deep learning for natural language processing tasks, focusing on emotion analysis.
